What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	
	there will be a .git folder. Because I want to have git to help me.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
	
	it is like a plan not carried out yet. while the other two are actual
	result.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
	by git diff, I can see what is included in this commit currently. It makes
	it easier to see what is going to be commited and whether it is a
	consistent logic unit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
	When you want to experiment a new feature or start something very different
	from the master branch, it is helpful to create a new branch. Branching can
	help since anything happenning inside a branch will not effect the master
	branch or other branches. It makes us confident for trying new things out.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
	the diagram is a tree structure and we can easily see the commit in each
	branch and their relationship.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
